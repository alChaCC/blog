## Virtual Fire 

> Virtual Fire was a mobile speedball game. 

We were trying to use infrared technology as emitter via Arduino, allowing users to play in any space. 

> Virtual Fire is not only a safe game but also easy to access. Players are able to play paintball games with their nearby friends on the street or in the campus.
